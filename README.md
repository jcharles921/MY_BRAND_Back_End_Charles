# Front-End for My Blog and Portfolio

This is the front-end part of my personal website, which serves as a blog and a portfolio of my work. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's designed to be responsive and accessible.

The front-end fetches data from a separate back-end GitHub repository, which provides the content for the blog posts and the portfolio projects. The back-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jcharles921) /jcharles921-My_Brand_Charles_BACKEND.

## Features

The website has the following features:

- Home page with a brief introduction, links to the blog and the portfolio, and a featured project or post.
- Blog page with a list of blog posts, each with a title, a summary, a date, and a link to the full post.
- Portfolio page with a list of projects, each with a title, a summary, a thumbnail image, and a link to the project.
- About page with a more detailed bio and a contact form.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Accessibility features such as semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation.
